Letter: Religion doesn't belong in science.

I could not resist commenting on the letter by Scott Crocoll ("There's room for creation, science," Jan. 27). Citing Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton, Gregor Mendel and Louis Pasteur, among others, Crocoll notes many famous scientists believed in creation. He says this establishes compatibility between creationism and science. It does not.

Science flatly contradicts creationism, which is the doctrine that the different species of organisms were independently created. The evidence for evolution of species (including our own) from common ancestors is overwhelming and mutually consistent with the laws of physics and chemistry.

Most of the scientists Crocoll cites were Christians unaware of the evidence for evolution, doubtless they can be given a pass if they accepted the story of the origin of animals and people in Genesis. But any contemporary scientists who believe in creationism are suffering from the well-known human foible of simultaneous belief in contradictory propositions.

Creationism and its transparently disguised version of intelligent design are religious beliefs that have no place in the science curriculum.
