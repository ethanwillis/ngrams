Letters: Turning off the power at San Onofre.

It is a sad state of affairs that "Edison will lay off 600 at San Onofre" [News, June 27]. A small group of people can close down the San Onofre nuclear plant permanently. I can't understand how we can continually throw out the baby with the bath water over and over again in so many aspects of our daily lives.

Nuclear energy is still the best and the cheapest energy available – particularly in Southern California, where we have air conditioners, 5,000-square-foot homes, energy-efficient lighting, gas-guzzling cars and two-and-a-half cars to every garage.

So many of us are spoiled-rotten children. "Not in my back yard" (or within five miles of me) is the refrain of the day. We hate change. We love luxury, and we hate, hate, hate having to wait in line. We want everything now.

Adding insult to injury, more than 1,100 workers may eventually be laid off. I am hopeful that Edison can hook these newly unemployed people up with the people who opposed San Onofre and nuclear energy.

Maybe they can help get jobs for those whom they so foolishly put out of work – or, at the very least, supplement their unemployment checks until they are able to get jobs.
