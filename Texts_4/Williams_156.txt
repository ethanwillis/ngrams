GMO Labeling Will Undermine Trust.

Getting food to the plates of New Yorkers and those beyond our borders is the work and passion of the members. From those who produce the highest quality seeds, to those who nurture the seeds into food and feed products, to those who feed and care for animals that provide everything from meat to yogurt, our organizations represent the diverse spectrum of the agriculture industry in New York state.

Nearly a quarter of the land in our state is used for agriculture. Our industries employ tens of thousands of New Yorkers and bring in billions of dollars in revenue and taxes. There is nothing more important to us as an industry than the public's trust and understanding.

That is why we feel strongly the labeling of foods containing genetically modified organisms will undermine that trust and cause confusion and a negative financial impact for the farmers, producers and consumers.

This coalition submitted a memo opposing S-3835A and A-3525A, legislation mandating labeling of food derived from genetically engineered crops.

Food that has been genetically modified is safe and no different than food that has not been genetically engineered. This has been determined in studies, and endorsed by the World Health Organization, the Food and Drug Administration, and the American Medical Association.

Labeling food can hurt farmers with increased production and distribution costs.

In addition to increased costs, food companies could reduce the number of products available for purchase. This would be especially detrimental to people in rural and urban settings where availability and cost is already an issue. Labeling could further impact these marketplaces with higher costs and fewer products.

Modifying seeds has gone on for thousands of years. Our members take pride in producing the best products. Mandatory labeling will harm our industry and threaten the bottom line of farmers, producers and consumers across New York.
