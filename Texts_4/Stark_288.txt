Teach children to critically evaluate theory of evolution.

In Kwame A. Mensah’s article "Creationism is an escape clause to not study science" (May 3), he urges us to teach and promote science, technology, engineering and math. As a scientist with a Ph.D. in molecular biology, I wholeheartedly agree. His example is the often emotional discussion around creation and evolution, but too often what seems to get lost in the debate is the science itself.

During my training several decades ago, I was taught evolutionary theory as fact, and given our knowledge at the time the theory seemed plausible. As a biological process, evolution can be observed and measured, and as such should be taught.

However, evolutionary theory has some major technical gaps. Darwin’s model can explain how species adapt to changing environments and perhaps the appearance of closely related species, but is grossly insufficient in explaining the origin of the diverse range of life we see today. I’ve yet to see a model that doesn’t have huge gaps or make assumptions with little supportive evidence. This doesn’t make them wrong, just not proven right. However, the data actually support (but cannot prove) the intervention of a creator.

Rather than avoiding these difficult technical problems, why not teach them? If we go back to the thesis that we should teach our children science, then let’s teach them to critically evaluate all the data and possibilities. If we limit their thinking, we limit their creativity. As a scientist, I don't find this threatening at all, nor is it threatening to me as a Christian.
