Nuclear power is a dangerous, dirty and expensive way to essentially boil water. More than 7 million people live within 50 miles of San Onofre, a plant that has suffered problems that, four months later, still have experts scratching their heads as to what caused them, not to mention how to solve them.

California can and should move beyond nuclear power. In fact, it already has 1 gigawatt of solar power on rooftops throughout the state, putting California roughly a quarter of the way toward replacing nuclear power with sunshine.

Other renewable energy technologies — including wind and biomass, along with proven energy efficiency and conservation measures — will enable California to keep the lights on, save ratepayers money and protect the health and safety of its residents.
