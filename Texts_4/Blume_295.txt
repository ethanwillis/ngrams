Evolution, not intelligent design, is embarrassing.

So letter-writer Elliot Fein thinks all professors should be Democrat because the right attacks "intelligent design," making the "United States look foolish in the world science community" ["It's intellectual self-interest," Aug. 16]? The real scientific embarrassment is evolution itself.

There is absolutely no explanation, for example, of how the heart or eye could possibly have evolved, since neither organ can function until all of the parts are present. There are no possible gradual steps. And no evolutionary scientist can come up with any theory as to how it could have occurred, not even with computer simulation. They have tried. Evolutionary "scientists" say that someday they will figure it out. But they won't, because heart and eye evolution is an impossibility. If eyes and hearts cannot evolve, evolution in its entirety is a sham.

Add to that the fact that there is no fossil record of any transitional species showing one species evolving into another; not one. There are no "fishigators," or, for that matter, partially evolved hearts and eyes. If evolution truly did happen, there would be millions of transitional fossils.

The day will come that millions of textbooks will have to be changed or dumped. And the Democrat college professors that Elliot Fein thinks are so smart will have the same fate for promoting "science" that isn't.
