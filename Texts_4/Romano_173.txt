Mandatory Labeling of GMO Foods Is a Good Start.

The editorial "License to label" (Feb. 18) supporting the voluntary labeling of GMO foods stated, “We read labels that for the most part we don't understand.” I believe people are smarter than that. Demanding to know what's in your food is an intelligent choice. Polls show that 90 percent of adults in this country support mandatory labeling of GMO foods.

Scientific evidence gives reasons to be wary of GMOs. As a result, France, Russia, Italy, Mexico and other countries banned the planting of a Monsanto GMO corn variety. These countries are not run by environmental extremists.

In the Feb. 21 Post-Dispatch, Monsanto's Lisa Safarian states that GMO crops offer farmers “net substantial environmental and economic benefits.” Evidence indicates otherwise. Because of GMO seeds, the price of corn and soy seed has skyrocketed, a cost passed on to consumers. Weeds grow resistant to Roundup herbicide, and bugs develop resistance to Monsanto's Bt crops. The result? Farmers are using more poisonous herbicides and pesticides.

Labeling will not significantly increase the price of food. Voluntary labeling is completely inappropriate. Let U.S. citizens make informed decisions with accurate information. A good start is the mandatory labeling of GMOs, as is required in over 50 other countries.
