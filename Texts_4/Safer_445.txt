Letter: EPA is mistaken in supporting nuclear power.

Thank you for the July 29 article on the EPA's Clean Power Plan hearings in Atlanta. This is a summary of my comments at the hearing:

Time is running out on our opportunity to change course to avoid the most drastic effects of climate change.

The EPA's Clean Power Plan is a good start. We must do more, sooner, but it is crucial that the federal government begin contributing to the solution. Many individuals, businesses, nonprofits, and state and local governments have already made much progress.

The truly clean electricity system of the future is here today: Energy efficiency, conservation and renewables are making huge centralized power plants obsolete. The Clean Power Plan greatly underestimates the revolution in electricity technology.

Unfortunately, the plan supports nuclear power as a part of the answer for carbon reduction. It is a mistake to exchange one environmental nightmare for another. The plan ignores nuclear fission's fatal, fundamental flaws. Nuclear reactors manufacture massive amounts of dangerous radiation.

Excess man-made atmospheric carbon is the devil this plan knows; man-made radiation is the one the EPA is missing. We must launch an all-out effort to build a carbon-free, nuclear-free energy system with renewables and energy efficiency. Our future depends on it.
