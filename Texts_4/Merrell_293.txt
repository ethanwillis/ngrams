Questioning Evolution.

Liz Craig agrees evolution is a theory, then declares “it’s science” and a “well-tested concept that explains a wide range of observations.” That oft-repeated dogma has served to evolve this theory into foregone conclusion, and while to question is an integral part of science, questioning this science is not tolerated.

As for “well tested”, no test reveals how something comes from nothing or how some simple inorganic cells can suddenly change into immensely complex DNA. Genuine science cannot answer these or the many other dilemmas swirling around of the origins of life no matter how confident we are in any theory.

Ms. Craig said evolution is so fundamental to science that in 2009, the Year of Science no less, the “nation” is celebrating the anniversaries of Darwin and his theory. If celebration yields substantiation, then generations taking part in the annual Christmas celebration do wonders for Santa’s credibility.
