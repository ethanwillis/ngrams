Mr. Doron is right that nuclear technology is ready and does not cause global warming, but he is wrong not to mention the problems of unresolved waste storage, earthquakes, exposure to cyber and regular terrorism or the potential concentration of the fuel for military use.

He is right that the new Westinghouse design of the reactors approved for Georgia, with its gravity-based natural water circulation, is a step in the right direction, but he is wrong to imply that this is enough.

The key safety problem is manual operation. If the Fukushima reactors were automatically flooded as soon as the earthquake was detected, not manually and only several hours after the tsunami hit, there would have been no accident.

And Mr. Doron is wrong about renewable energy! In only a couple of years, all the roofs of new buildings could be covered by solar instead of regular shingles and could be provided with bidirectional meters to guarantee the continuous availability of electricity and the creation of millions of jobs.

Yes, Mr. Doron is right that our aging nuclear plants have to be shut down, but he is wrong to suggest that we can afford to build new ones or that solar energy is not ready to take over. It is, and it is not only safe, clean and inexhaustible, but also a fuel that is free.
