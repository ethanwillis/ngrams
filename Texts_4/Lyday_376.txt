The safety of coal vs. nuclear energy.

If 25 people had been killed in a nuclear power plant accident in the U.S. or China, the world would have come unglued and press coverage would have gone on for months (years?). Nuclear power would be shut down forever.

Three Mile Island is still in the lexicon 31 years after the incident, even though not one person was killed or injured.

Sadly, the world will have forgotten the deadly coal mine accidents in China and West Virginia in just a matter of days, just as we have forgotten the hundreds of fatal mining accidents since Three Mile Island.

It seems society treats coal mine disasters as just the price of getting cheap energy, just as 40,000 U.S. highway deaths a year are the price of being mobile. But to even have a rational discussion about safe, non-global-warming nuclear power? Horrors!

Since the word “nuclear” is so inflammatory in the minds of people who do not understand the overwhelming safety and other advantages of nuclear power, perhaps we need to come up with a new word. I propose “carbonless” energy. Let’s build hundreds of carbonless energy plants to save the world from global warming and create tens of thousands of jobs.
