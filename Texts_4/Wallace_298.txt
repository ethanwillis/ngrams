Thousands of credentialed scientists disbelieve evolution.

David Grow asserts that “there is no controversy among scientists” and “that evolutionary science is the product of 150 years of critical thinking and objective analysis.” Critical thinking? Molecular biology and mathematical probabilities now preclude even the remotest chance that incredibly complex cellular life could have arisen by random chance. Charles Darwin's “single, simple cell” is now a laughable concept, as is Oxford evolutionist Richard Dawkins' supposition that life must have been brought here by an advanced alien race.

Thousands of credentialed scientists now disbelieve evolution. Objective analysis? Darwin also claimed we would find large numbers of transitional fossils linking the various major animal groups on his “Tree of Life.” Please explain the sudden appearance in the Cambrian Age of fully formed animal groups in astounding variety, with neither apparent ancestors nor evolved descendants. From hundreds of millions of fossils and vast research of nature today, we only observe species variations, not proven evolution. We've never observed life from nonlife. How about critically rethinking our science education system?
