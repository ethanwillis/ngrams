Power U.S. with nuclear energy.

Popularizing natural gas power plants appears costly. We should seriously consider maintaining and expanding our “steady Eddy” energy sources — nuclear and coal.

Just look what happened during the last cold snap. The high demand for natural gas escalated the cost of electric power in some areas by more than 30 times normal levels. Specifically on the New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania grid, megawatt hour rates went from $40-$50 to $500-$1,500. Increased use for home heating, transportation, manufacturing and overseas sales will only dramatically increase the average future natural gas price, making alternate energy sources competitive.

There is a lot to be said in favor of stably priced power from reliable electric power plants. That includes coal and nuclear, now in significant decline, demonized unjustly by factoid-based environmental issues. Our coal plants are much cleaner than most in the world.

Meanwhile, China remains the world’s largest consumer of coal. The whole world will breathe and be warmed by its emissions. We should use our cleaner coal plants to produce cheap energy to support manufacturing here, rather than encouraging more manufacturing in China.

Atomic power is presently more expensive but safe and reliable and doesn’t emit greenhouse gases. Fifty years of design experience have created safe reactor designs. Recycling spent fuel reduces atomic waste while permitting centuries of reliable nuclear power.

A rational, fact-based, U.S. energy policy would capitalize on the true value of our “steady Eddy” energy sources.
