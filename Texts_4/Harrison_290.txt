Science of Darwin and his disciples is phony.

Your report about an upcoming creation vs. evolution debate ("Belief St. Louis," Feb. 1) tells us atheist Richard Dawkins refuses to debate evolution skeptics because no such deluded knuckle-dragger deserves even to be "seen sharing a platform with a real scientist." Maybe the true reason is that Darwin's disciples usually lose such debates: Their opponents easily expose that "real science" as phony science.

For instance, instead of the myriads of transitional fossil forms between species that Darwin predicted would be found if his theory were valid (including those resulting from "unfit" as well as "fit" mutations), all evolutionists can produce 150 years later is the same old handful of doubtful examples. Moreover, they can never explain how today's organisms could have evolved by countless tiny steps, each being an improvement over the previous (as Darwin's theory demands), when extremely complex structures had to be already in place in order for any individual just to be alive â€” never mind reproduce. For example, how could an animal species' heart and lungs each have evolved in tiny steps? Since neither organ can function without the other, any animal will be "dead on arrival" unless both are up and running from Day One.

In 2009, Dawkins published "The Greatest Show in Earth: the Evidence for Evolution." This supposedly unanswerable work was promptly and brilliantly rebutted point by point by New Zealand scientist Jonathan Sarfati in "The Greatest Hoax on Earth: Refuting Dawkins on Evolution." Dawkins has never replied. One suspects he can't.
