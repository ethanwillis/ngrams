Congressman is right in challenging Darwin's theory.

Regarding the Associated Press story and Bill McClellan’s column about Georgia congressman Dr. Paul Broun, who doubts the motives and scientific nature of Darwinian evolution, and his fitness to sit on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, I wish to voice my support on the basis that he has the guts to state what many people have concluded. Darwinism is a failed theory, unable to demonstrate the why and how of its workings or the evidences of it.

Lack of evidence is why some who still hold to evolution have embraced massive, complete changes, rather than slow, gradual ones. The Darwinian mechanisms of passing down acquired characteristics and the evolutionary stages in embryology have been debunked, although some still hold to a type of spontaneous generation for life to begin from non-life or even resort to space visitors planting it. Geological ages have been shown to be complete and in order only on paper, as have fossils’ constructed appearance, habitat and familial arrangements.

The founders of science’s branches (Lister, Pasteur, Newton, Kepler, etc) were creationists and I guess, accordingly, “anti-science,” which is a terrible thing to say but, I guess, the greatest tragedy is that articles can be published by the ignorant or uninformed.

I remember the movie “Inherit The Wind,” in which Spencer Tracy, portraying Clarence Darrow, theorized that if God had created man he must have given him a brain with which to think. Well, dear Clarence, not everyone uses it.
