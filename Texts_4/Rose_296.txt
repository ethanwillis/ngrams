Evolution contradicts Bible and good science.

Professor Michael Zimmerman's online My View ("Believers accepting evolution," Feb. 11) is literally filled with mistakes and misconceptions that should embarrass Butler -- both his and my university.

We don't have to choose between modern science and religion for one simple reason: God's laws are the laws of science. The theory of evolution contradicts not only the Bible but good science, which totally rejects the spontaneous generation of life.

The complexity and functioning of the molecular building blocks of life are now telling us an entirely different story than Charles Darwin did 150 years ago.

Zimmerman says that we have observed the creation of new species. That is true and in complete harmony with God's laws of science. What we have not seen is a brand-new basic kind of life that never existed before. He misleads by stating that the Discovery Institute and the intelligent design movement are trying to move science away from evolutionary, naturalistic explanations of the material world. But true science should search for scientifically logical explanations and not be boxed in by Zimmerman's limitations.

That the theory of evolution is being disproved is in no way a threat to those earnestly seeking truth, but is evidence we are making progress in the field of science.
