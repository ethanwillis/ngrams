Bible Does Not Accurately Describe Scientific Reality.

Dean Klatt's claim in his Feb. 22 letter that "the Bible that describes the Creator and creation is (as Christians know) extremely supportive of itself, consistent, reliable and accurate" is 100 percent true. It accurately describes biblical creation. What it does not accurately describe is anything that is remotely grounded in scientific reality. You cannot use the Bible to prove the Bible.

"The Lord of the Rings" and "Harry Potter" are both "extremely supportive of (themselves), consistent, reliable, and accurate" in their tellings of those stories. Should we believe that elves, dwarves, hobbits and men banded together long ago to defeat Sauron, or there's a school for wizards called "Hogwarts"? Of course not, and there's more books (evidence?) of those stories than anything biblical.

Mr. Klatt also wrote of the suppression of "the mountain of evidence that unravels this (evolution's) absurd idea." Mr. Klatt, if there is legitimate evidence that proves, independently of the Bible, that Christian creationism is correct, and at the same time disproves evolution, then the Nobel Prize awaits. Let's see what evidence creationists have for your particular creation myth. No one is suppressing the evidence for creationism because there is none that doesn't come from the Bible. And that is unacceptable as evidence.
