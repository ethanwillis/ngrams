Bob Metcalfe's praise for new "mini" nuclear plants ignores some basic facts.

Small, dispersed nuclear reactors raise a host of unresolved safety and security issues. There would be significant challenges to ensure even the same public safety and security levels as those at current plants, which are, in any case, deficient.

Proposed small reactor designs include novel features which require careful review. Mr. Metcalfe wants to speed up the approval process but it cannot be safely accelerated.

There is no market. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission isn't inclined to waste its limited resources on licensing small reactor designs when there is no firm domestic utility interest.

Big or small, nuclear plants are plagued by significant safety, security, and long-term waste-disposal problems. Lower-cost technologies, such as energy efficiency and wind, and other renewable energy sources, are safer and more secure, and could be deployed much more quickly. Mr. Metcalfe and his venture-capitalist colleagues would better serve the public by investing in these more promising technologies.
