If It's An Organism and it Exists Today, It is a GMO.

Every living thing is a genetically modified organism. If it did not exist in nature 150 or even 100 years ago, it is a GMO.

Think about those wonderful seedless grapes and that perfectly formed, ultrasweet ear of corn and those absolutely wonderful tomatoes that we grew from seed with their exotic names. Then, consider those tens of dollars a pound ultramarbled prime-beef filet and how they bred the taste and tenderness out of pork to give us the other white something or other.

All of those items did not exist in nature 150 years ago or less.

You can call all of these things hybrids, or a product of selective breeding, but they really are GMOs. The basic rule is: If it had parents or pollen, then it is a GMO.

OMG! That means our parents were GMOs, we are GMOs, and our children and grandchildren are GMOs.

I guess that a GMO is not so bad after all!
