Don't Eat Up Pro-GMO Arguments Just Yet.

The genetically modified organism argument in context of genetically modified foods has little to do with the political left or right. It is a story about power and greed [“Diet rich in irony,” Opinion, April 27].

In 1933 the Journal of the American Medical Association began publishing cigarette ads claiming that cigarettes were, “Just as pure as the water you drink.” It wasn’t until the 1950s that the links between cancer and cigarettes began showing up. It was even later still that JAMA stopped taking money from its most lucrative advertiser, the cigarette industry. Because of the cigarette industry’s relationships and donations to politicians, it took another decade before there was any government action. Today, the same thing is happening with GMOs. Millions of dollars flow to politicians on both sides of the aisle to keep federal legislation at bay.

Many articles link GMOs to unintended health consequences in humans, and it seems pretty clear that those supporting GMOs are sponsored or paid for by the GMO industry – just like what happened with tobacco.

Those who are against GMOs fight a multibillion-dollar industry. How many years will go by before the link between putting toxic chemicals into the DNA of plant seeds and human cancer is confirmed? Articles have linked GMO to herbicide-resistant insects and the growth of herbicide-resistant superweeds.

Advances in technology are important to mankind. They can be good or evil. One of the first things our Congress should do is outlaw the production of any food or crop seed that has sterile offspring. Imagine the power of a company that controls the supply of the world’s food because it alone manufactures the seed. When greed or power are the main goal of technology, mankind suffers.
