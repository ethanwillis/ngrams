Respect for science.

I agree with almost nothing Charles Krauthammer says, so I felt a breath of fresh air to read that an arch-conservative like him actually agrees with something a group of scientists said ("Gone in 60 nanoseconds", Commentary, Oct. 10). He reported that the Gran Sasso physicists checked their discovery of a faster-than-light neutrino six ways from Sunday, trying to find an error or flaw that would disprove their discovery, but try as they might, they couldn't find an error or a flaw. Then they invited scientists around the world to duplicate their experiment and see it they could find a flaw.

Conservatives such as Krauthammer have made a national sport out of doubting and discrediting the rational voice of science to justify their monomaniacal refutation of global warming caused by human activity. Climate scientists have checked and double-checked the evidence and data on global warming for the past 60 years and determined that yes, human activity has indeed been a driving force behind the Earth's warming climate.

In the harsh glare of this conclusion, conservatives continue to claim it's all hooey, usually basing their criticism on the dubious research by a handful of "researchers" whose funding can be traced back to the energy companies and other polluters. For Krauthammer to actually agree with the scientific community is tantamount to Sarah Palin agreeing that Barack Obama is a great president. Wonders never cease.
