I am writing in strong support of Mr. Doron’s letter identifying nuclear energy as the only clean and reliable answer to the world’s future energy needs. It is the only nonpolluting energy source that can provide the steady base needs of the power grid into the future.

As he says, the modern nuclear plants as approved for Georgia are passively safe, requiring no operator intervention to shut down in an emergency. One design, the Generation IV Integral Fast Reactor, goes even further in providing an answer to the waste problem through recycling and use of all the energy available in the fuel.

Modern reactors are being built overseas in many countries. If the United States is to be a major player in the world’s energy future, we must advance our nuclear power programs as quickly as possible.
