Assuming that Mr. Doronâ€™s assertion that modern nuclear power plants can be operated safely is accurate, he leaves two important questions unanswered. First, how can we safely dispose of the spent fuel rods? And how can the world monitor the enrichment of uranium to the level needed for power plants, but insufficient for nuclear weapons?

Although construction of safe nuclear power plants may be feasible, and may help meet rising energy needs in the short term, ignoring the longer term implications of nuclear power may lead to even bigger problems.
