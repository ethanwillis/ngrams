I'm a retired nuclear engineer and feel compelled to comment on Bob Metcalfe's "The New Nuclear Revolution." He makes an excellent point for nuclear energy. It is a nonpolluting (no CO2 whatsoever) source of electricity generation. The U.S. could generate 100% of its base-load electricity-generation needs using nuclear power, as it attempted to do four decades ago.

Unfortunately, at that time the industry was hit with questionable and expensive regulatory requirement changes extending completion times during a period of 15% interest rates, without being able to expense costs until the first watt of power was produced. Add to this that an operating license was far from guaranteed even though the go-ahead to build was granted. The industry became noncompetitive with coal plants, and withered and died even before the events of Three Mile Island. More than 100 plants were canceled. The real nuclear revolution needs to be revitalized using the large and improved reactor designs now being offered. Safe fission power is here now.
