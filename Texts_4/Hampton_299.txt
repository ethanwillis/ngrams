Evolutionary science wishful thinking and subjective guesswork.

David Grow (Your Views, Feb. 20) claims that evolutionary science “is the product of 150 years of critical thinking and objective analysis.” Actually, it's the product of 150 years of wishful thinking and subjective guesswork. Grow wrote, “Certainly there is debate over cutting-edge details, and a lot more remains to be learned.” Grow is a master of understatement. But then “How did life begin?” could be considered a cutting-edge detail. Or how about something a little simpler, like how could anything as complex as the human eye evolve by chance?

If the case for evolution were as strong as its proponents would have you believe, all they'd have to do is “trot out their proof” and silence their critics. Instead, they're doing all they can to suppress any and all scientific evidence that's critical of their so-called theory. Since neither creation nor evolution has been scientifically proven, they both rest on faith. But a favorite tactic of evolutionists is to claim evolution is science and intelligent design is religion.

Yet even militant evolutionists have had to admit there is an “appearance" of design in nature. Grow would also have you believe that creationist organizations are the only ones questioning evolution. This is simply not true.
