Intelligent design is evident in nature.

Recent letters criticizing columnist Russ Pulliam, and intelligent design theory, are very revealing by what they do not include — any solid evidence for their competing theory of the evolution of life.

Evolutionists handicap themselves, and therefore students in classrooms, by requiring that all their reasoning include only a “natural” explanation of how life came about.

One need to only look at any seed — an apple seed for example. There is absolutely no way any seed happened solely by accident — by natural means. It is not logical, and therefore terribly unscientific. The apple seed has the entire program within it to produce a tree with scores of new apples, each one containing several seeds which, individually, can in turn can do the same thing — ad infinitum! There is a saying, “Man can count the seeds in an apple, but only God can count the apples in a seed.” To be so blind as to not see the absolute requirement of an intelligence far beyond that of mankind in explaining life — be it apple seeds or human beings — is akin to not being able to see the forest for the trees.
