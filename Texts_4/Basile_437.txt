Letter: Embrace potential of nuclear energy.

President Barack Obama's climate plan highlights the important role of clean energy sources, including nuclear, in reducing carbon pollution ("Obama adds voice for safer planet," June 26).

Seeking to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 17 percent from their 2005 level by 2020 will be very difficult without nuclear energy, which generates a significant amount of electricity with near-zero emissions. New York is fortunate to have several nuclear power plants, and there is no coincidence that New York is a national leader in low carbon emissions. The Indian Point nuclear power plant is particularly important, as it provides 11 percent of the state's total electric power. Experts have found that closing the plant would increase state carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent, a major step in the wrong direction.

We would be wise to recognize the potential of nuclear energy to help us meet our future electricity needs in a matter that will effectively address climate change â€” arguably the greatest challenge of our time.
