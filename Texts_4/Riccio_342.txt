Greenpeace: Phase out nuclear reactors.

Wall Street has long known that nuclear power is an abysmal investment and isn't willing to accept the risks. Moody's called new nuclear power a "bet the farm" risk, while Citi described nuclear power as a "corporation killer." MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, concluded that it did not make "economic sense" to build. After a South Carolina corporation invested in a new nuclear power plant, Moody's downgraded its stock to near junk bond status. And Fitch has done the same to corporations that continue to pursue nuclear power.

That's why the industry needs enormous taxpayer support to build nuclear plants, in the form of loan guarantees, a bailout when a meltdown occurs and more. Taxpayers shouldn't be forced to bear the risks for a mature technology that banks won't finance, especially one that threatens a catastrophic release of radiation. Some 100 million Americans already live within 50 miles of a nuclear plant. We should be phasing out these dangerous reactors, not building more.

Wall Street and the rest of America actually agree on this. Two-thirds of Americans don't want to be placed on the hook for new nuclear plants.

Nuclear power is too slow and expensive to address global warming. Real solutions are fast, affordable and ready now. Making our buildings more energy efficient is 10 times more cost effective than new nuclear; clean, renewable energy from wind and solar is getting cheaper as technology improves and markets expand.

In 2009 and 2010, the U.S. installed more than 15,000 megawatts of wind power. Meanwhile, the last nuclear power plant to come online in this country was in 1996, cost $8 billion and took 23 years to complete.
