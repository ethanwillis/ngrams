Support GMO Food-Labeling In NJ.

Industry-paid scientists claim that genetically engineered crops, or GMOs, benefit farmers, consumers and the environment. I ask, how?

For decades, the American countryside has been gutted of its farms by agribusiness, whatever the human or environmental costs. Since the end of World War II, America has lost a farm every half-hour.

Non-diverse industrial monocultures have taken their place, growing one thing at a time with minimal crop rotation and massive use of toxic chemicals. GMO technology is the enabling catalyst for this. GM crops have never been tested for safety by the FDA, USDA or EPA, while hundreds of peer-reviewed, independent scientific studies have shown highly problematic outcomes.

This model is destructive and unsustainable with current practices destroying 6 pounds of soil for every pound of food produced. 

We then get to consume increasing amounts of cheap, heavily processed, unlabeled GMO “foods” often consisting of nothing more than various chemical recombinations of genetically manipulated corn, soy, canola and refined sugar, lacking nutrition.

Right now, there is a major battle being waged on who controls our food: the people or corporate America. Tell your legislators to support the GMO labeling bill for New Jersey.
