GMO Products Need To Be Labeled.

The food industry has drastically changed in the last several years.

Genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, are a fast rising phenomena that affect every human being in the United States. Food that is genetically modified is found on the shelves of most supermarkets. GMOs are not required to be labeled, either.

It is difficult for American consumers to be informed shoppers when they are unaware about the truth about the products they are purchasing. Most Americans have heard of GMOs and are aware of what they are, but they do not realize how many common foods are actually genetically modified. Up to 70 percent of processed foods are genetically modified.

GMOs are a growing problem for the United States. Genetically modified organisms have been linked to various allergies and diseases. As GMOs take over the food industry, it becomes increasingly difficult to eat healthy, uncontaminated organic foods. Many other countries see GMOs as unsafe and have thus put restrictions on the manufacture of such products. Numerous countries, including the European Union, Japan and Australia, have bans or limitations that prohibit GMOs. Unfortunately, the United States is behind in GMO developments.

GMOs should be labeled, at the very least, so that people can be properly educated on the foods that they are eating. Whether consumers want to eat organic is a choice, but it is impossible for people to make a choice when they donâ€™t know the facts. If people knew that the products they were purchasing were GMOs, they might think twice before taking them off the shelf.
