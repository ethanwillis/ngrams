Obituaries premature for prospects of nuclear expansion.

Day by day, the news from the stricken nuclear reactors in Japan has grown worse. If you, like we, have been hoping that the long-touted renaissance of American nuclear power would finally materialize, then post-earthquake events in Japan are likely to shake your optimism and your confidence.

Yes, obituaries are being written this week for the prospects of nuclear expansion. But we think and hope those obits are premature. Much depends on what happens in Japan. If the Japanese avert a full-scale meltdown, the scare fades. If, on the other hand, escaping radiation creates an even greater public health crisis, then the chances for a reinvigorated nuclear industry plummet.

But let's step back. At the end of this scary episode, all of us still want the same thing: to be able to turn on the lights, juice an iPad or recharge a Chevy Volt.

Let's also remember that other mega-sources of power plant fuel carry their own proven dangers.

Coal? The 2010 explosion in the Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia killed 29 miners. Coal plants spew pollution that causes lung disease and heart attacks. The Nuclear Energy Institute calculates that from 1995 to 2009, generating power from atoms instead of coal kept 20 million tons of nitrogen oxides and 51 million tons of sulfur dioxide out of the nation's air.

Oil and natural gas? Last spring's Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels, snuffing out wildlife and livelihoods all along the coast. Around the globe, extraction workers often die in oil and gas accidents.
