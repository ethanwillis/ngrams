Nuclear power remains safe source of energy.

To call into question the safety record of the nuclear power industry after a magnitude 9.0 earthquake damaged a Japanese plant is absurd. Everyone is so quick to jump onto the anti-atom bandwagon, but has anyone cared to consider the abysmal safety record of the coal mining and oil industries? And is the public really that concerned about radiation exposure?

Coal mining has killed a great number of people as a result of tunnel collapses and respiratory diseases. The oil industry possesses an equally distasteful safety record â€” just look at BP's so-called mishap in the Gulf of Mexico. More controversially, look at how the quest to secure oil has gotten the United States mired knee-deep in the tumult that is Mideast politics.

As far as radiation exposure is concerned, whether we are aware of it, we are exposed to radiation on a daily basis. Sunburn, for instance, is a type of radiation burn. Many of us think of it as little more than an annoyance. Radiation is just a natural byproduct of nuclear fission.

Nuclear energy does not emit greenhouse gases. Nuclear fission is a clean, safe and viable energy source. It is the future.
