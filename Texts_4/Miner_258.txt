Misguided arguments against evolution.

Regarding the Rev. Brian W. Harrison’s scathing indictment of Charles Darwin and Richard Dawkins ("Science of Darwin and his disciples is phony," Feb. 7), it is impossible for a trained biologist (which Jonathan Sarfati is not) to argue with a creationist, when the creationist’s response is essentially “Look out the window. That beautiful world, and the complex eyes with which I view it, could not have arisen without a Creator." Egyptians, Greeks and most other civilizations had similar thoughts. But there is no tangible evidence for a Creator; there are only misguided arguments against evolution.

The reverend’s heart and lung example might sound reasonable to the general public, thanks in part to the suppression of the teaching of evolution. But that each organ evolved over a very long period of time from more primitive structures present in the ancestors we share with lower animals can be readily explained by developmental and evolutionary biology. In addition, it is well-established in the laboratory that certain mammalian proteins can perform the same highly specialized function in lowly worms that the related worm protein performs. Is the explanation: (1) overlapping function due to conservation of the common ancestral protein’s structure and function over the many millions of years since the two groups diverged; or (2) an intelligent Creator designed it that way? The evidence supports No. 1; creationism supports No. 2.
