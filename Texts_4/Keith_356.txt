It is indeed a fine mess with the steam generators at the San Onofre power plant just south of Orange County, but it is not an excuse to abandon the plant or nuclear energy. Regardless of the financial outcome, it will still be less expensive to fix or replace the steam generators, hopefully with a big contribution from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, than to build new plants of any kind or to buy power from out of state.

Nuclear plants in California do not pose a higher risk to the public from seismic activity or from being on the coast, as their designs take into account those issues. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, thorough new reviews of safety systems will assure that the risks are negligible.

Your editorial is right that nuclear energy offers clean power, and for the foreseeable future.

California and the rest of the country need it to meet economic and environmental demands. Rather than giving up on San Onofre, we need to press on to solve the problem.
