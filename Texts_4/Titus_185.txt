No Consensus That GMOs Are Safe.

With a flourish of The Courant's unilateral and biased pen, it has deemed that labeling GMOs is unnecessary to the health of consumers despite the growing consensus among scientists, physicians, academics and experts that GMOs may be destroying our health and the planet.

The truth of the matter is that there is no consensus between industry and independent organizations such as the Center for Food Safety, the Environmental Working Group, the Center for Science in the Public Interest and the European Network of Scientists. These organizations have nothing to gain by questioning the safety of GMOs, while industry has everything to gain by promoting their safety.

Many of the studies that the editorial referred to actually show significant differences in the health of GMO-fed animals, but the authors dismissed these findings as insignificant. We have been ingesting GMOs for the last 20 years without one human study evaluating whether there are health affects as a result of eating GMOs.

In fact, during this same time, the health of our population has been declining with increasing incidence of obesity, cancer, allergies, and gastrointestinal and autoimmune disease. I am not waiting until there is consensus that GMOs are safe, because they are not. I want labeling now!
