Nuclear energy is no alternative.

The events around the Japanese quake and nuclear-reactor damage are tragic and will be repeated again in some other iteration as long as we embrace nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. The damage to the nuclear reactor and release of nuclear waste compound the tragedy of the earthquake because they now likely condemn the people of Japan (especially the children) to higher rates of cancer over the following decades as well as an expensive cleanup of waste that has an extraordinarily long half-life.

The Japanese government put down the most sophisticated system possible to prevent this exact course of events and it still happened. As we mourn this catastrophe, I hope we do not forego the opportunity to learn from it as well. We owe it to ourselves and the Japanese people.
