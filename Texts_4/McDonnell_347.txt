We have all watched with shock and sadness the recent events in Japan. While Americans donate generously to relief efforts, we must also keep a proper perspective about what Japanâ€™s disaster means for energy policy here. I believe it would be most unwise to let this unprecedented tragedy lead to the retraction or abandonment of the American nuclear energy industry. Nuclear energy is clean, reliable, affordable and critical to generating the volume of electricity we need to power our homes and businesses and grow our economy.

Virginia is home to two nuclear facilities, in Surry and Louisa counties. They generate roughly 40 percent of our electricity. They have multiple redundant systems to provide backup electrical power. The stations were also analyzed against worst-case acts of nature, such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes, and modified as necessary to protect them. There are 19 emergency drills scheduled for this year.

We must use all our God-given resources here in America to pursue our goal of greater energy security. Nuclear energy is an important part of our energy portfolio. Virginia is moving forward with plans to build a third reactor in Louisa, and I support that effort. We should of course learn from the tragedy in Japan and use the unparalleled ingenuity and know-how of American scientists and our free-enterprise system to ensure that our nuclear plants continue to be prepared and improved. What we should not do is turn our back on an industry that provides needed clean and affordable energy while creating good jobs for Americans.
