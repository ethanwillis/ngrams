Should we abandon nuclear energy or move ahead on it?

On the day after Earth Day, of all days, how could The Post omit the overriding problem with nuclear power — exceedingly long-lived radioactive waste from nuclear plants? This poisonous waste should never be put in the same sentence with the word “clean.” Nuclear power is the most dangerous form of energy production because we still don’t know what to do with radioactive fuel rods once they are spent.

Would The Post have written the same editorial if a nearby nuclear plant (the North Anna power station in Virginia, for instance) had suffered meltdowns and contaminated an area similar to that caused by Japan’s Fukushima plant?
