Evidence of evolution.

We would like to address the scientific misconceptions presented by Brian Merrell (2/8, Letters, “Questioning evolution”). The scientific definition of “theory” is a body of rigorously tested ideas that constitute our current understanding of physical phenomena. The theory of evolution describes the unity of life through what Charles Darwin termed “descent with modification” — what we now understand as changes in gene frequencies in populations over generations.

Evolution thus does not address how life got here; it addresses the diversity of life that’s here now and how that diversity arose. The evidence of evolution is overwhelming, testable and can be seen everywhere, including in the development of bacterial antibiotic resistance.

Moreover, questioning evolution is absolutely tolerated. Questioning is the first step of the scientific method. Additionally, time is key in evolution: One substance does not suddenly produce another. Present-day biodiversity is the consequence of billions of years of progressive change. Further, cells are not inorganic (incidentally, organic compounds have formed from inorganic molecules).

Each time you jump into the air, you “celebrate” the theory of gravity. Circular logic does not substantiate this theory; only extensive and repeated testing has done so.
