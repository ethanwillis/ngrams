Anti-evolution efforts are lost cause.

Don Paul's letter regarding evolution was an example of eloquence in defense of the indefensible. His misconceptions were well-elucidated, but easily refuted. Anti-evolutionist writers often cite "non-repeatability" as failure to meet the terms of the scientific method. But it is not the case that there have been no repeatable experiments in evolution; for example, generations of fruit flies, and other species, have been studied. Aside from that, the repeatability is in the data. The consistency with which evolutionary biology demonstrates the reliability of the principle of evolution in nature is overwhelming. It works logically. It works mathematically. And the mountains of data from biological studies over more than a hundred years have borne this out.

The only parties with motive to dispute evolution are religious fundamentalists who want to posit that the Bible's creation myths are literally true. Nothing else drives anti-evolutionism; certainly nothing purely scientific. They really can't expect rational, modern people to accept the crackpot pseudo-science of Creationism as equivalent, and worthy of being taught alongside, real science. It is the size of a flea. Evolutionary science is a whole planet. Anti-evolutionism is a lost cause, and diverts the energies and attention of a lot of well-meaning Christians, to the benefit of no one. It has no relevance to the teachings of Christ. And it contributes nothing to modern, secular, academic education.
