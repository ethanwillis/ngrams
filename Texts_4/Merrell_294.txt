Evolution is supernatural, too.

Secular wisdom scoffs at the theory of creation, calling it religion, while it reveres the theory of evolution as fact. Declaring a theory fact does not make it so, nor is the assertion scientific. Webster defines religion as “the service or worship of God or the supernatural.” Creation and evolution both mix interpretation of the world around us with the supernatural.

Evolution breaks various laws of science that, by definition, can never be broken. It says that what is scientifically impossible, such as evolution between species, will supernaturally occur given millions of years of random chance. Pigs will fly, given enough time and good fortune. Come on, have a little faith.

Regarding the fossil record Charles Darwin wrote about in his The Origin of Species, “Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory.”

It’s more than a century later, and little has changed other than calling his theory a fact.

Life and science go on while each of us believes what we will about our origin because nobody really knows for sure, this side of heaven.
