We don't need a nuclear plant.

This past week marked the 32nd anniversary of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. A cooling system failed at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, causing a partial meltdown.

Fortunately, there were no fatalities and a full meltdown was averted, but only after 40,000 gallons of radioactive waste water were released into the Susquehanna River. Radioactive gases and incredibly dangerous iodine 131 also were released.

Nuclear energy is a force that man still has not been able to harness without incident. The highest risk variable is the volatility of nuclear fuel when combined with the unpredictable and uncontrollable force of nature.

Yes, nuclear power is clean and efficient, but has mankind arrived at a level of technology to be able to use it and control it? I don't think so.

Consider the nuclear disaster in Japan. Do you want the potential of a meltdown or, at the very least, living with the threat of evacuation, in your backyard? How will this affect our beautiful countryside and real estate values?

Local officials want to explore the viability of a nuclear plant in Easton, across the Hudson River from Schuylerville and within 10 miles as the crow flies of downtown Saratoga Springs.

The question we all need to ask is: When there is a puff of smoke, are we prepared to leave all of our worldly possessions and communities?

As a 30-year resident of this beautiful countryside, I am not. Rep. Chris Gibson, put it in your backyard in Kinderhook and see what your neighbors say.
