Nuclear waste can be kept safe.

Your Feb. 17, "No nuclear option," editorial is off base. The option for dealing with nuclear waste was enacted into law by Congress years ago.

The law requires establishment of an underground waste repository. For this purpose, some $20 billion to $30 billion has been collected from rate payers served by nuclear generating plants. Some $10 billion has been expended to establish a repository. Presidents and Congress have supported Yucca Mountain for this repository.

You are remiss for not asking why that site isn't receiving high-level nuclear waste.

The answer is simple: President Barack Obama is in violation of the law. He ordered the Department of Energy to defund this repository, and that has been done. Congress continues to allow this. It should follow the Constitution and remove the law or impeach the President for violating it.

Yucca was to have received its first waste in 1998. Since it hasn't, utilities were forced to put dry storage casks on site. That storage system is extremely safe. If all the radioactive waste created to date by U.S. nuclear power plants were put in one location, it would fill only one football seven yards deep, the industry estimates.

Since nuclear power plants do not emit air pollutants such as sulfur and nitrous oxides or greenhouse gases, nuclear power is one of the cleanest ways we have to create electricity. To not build new nuclear plants because a decision on the waste has not been made does not make sense and would do more environmental harm than good. To not keep operating and building nuclear power plants is a disservice to future generations.

The conclusion of your editorial is wrong. We have a solution: Government gets busy, and get it done.
