Marvin Maddox: Nuclear is the future.

John Dudley’s April 21 Point of View, “ Why green energy mandates don’t work,” seems to miss the point. We all recognize that green energy is currently more expensive than fossil fuel energy.

However, most states have decided that continuing to add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is definitely not in our best interest. Perhaps they also recognize that the cost of green energy will gradually decrease, while the cost of fossil fuels can be expected to rise as they become more scarce.

Incidentally, drilling for oil off the North Carolina coast would have its downside. The first significant spill would probably end the careers of the politicians who supported the drilling.

Actually, I think we should be building more nuclear reactors. How many Americans have ever been hurt by nuclear reactors? Are people in Wake County afraid of the reactor in our county? A combination of nuclear and green energy would be ideal for the next thousand years or beyond. And store the nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain.

France currently gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power.
