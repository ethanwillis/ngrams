An abundance of evidence on 'change-in-kind' evolution.

Terry Reeves obviously isn’t aware of scientific evidence supporting “change-in-kind” evolution. Evidence of natural selection producing adaptation and speciation (“change-in-kind”) is abundant in science. A Google Scholar search for “observation of production of new species of organisms” yields numerous results, so Reeves’ statement about the absence of observational evidence is wrong. This invalidates the rest of his argument that “change-in-kind” evolution can only be accepted by faith.

A search for “production of new species of organisms” also yields numerous results. So when scientists speak of overwhelming evidence, this is what they’re talking about. Reeves’ argument that speciation requires eons in time can apply only to organisms with long generation times. Organisms with generation times measuring in minutes, hours, days or even weeks can produce hundreds to hundreds of thousands of generations within a span of weeks, months or several years.

Scientists working with these organisms have observed formation of new species in environments they experimentally manipulate and forming spontaneously resulting from random mutation and natural selection. Such studies are predictive, repeatable and verifiable.

Evolution and speciation aren’t a matter of faith or belief. They’re a matter of evidence, an abundance of evidence, that contrasts with an almost complete lack of contradictory evidence.
