Give New Yorkers A Choice On GMOs.

I was disappointed to see an industry propaganda piece claiming to be in the best interest of New Yorkers (“GMO labeling will undermine trust,” March 15). Jeff Williams’ argument against the labeling of genetically modified organisms is positively Orwellian double talk. He is a corporate mouthpiece for a large special interest group whose claims of safety for GMOs are absolutely unfounded.

As a physician, I am deeply concerned about the long-term impact of this biotech experiment being conducted on New Yorkers. There is a growing mountain of evidence to indicate that GMOs are detrimental to consumers, the environment and farmers’ interests. GMO seeds were engineered to be resistant to herbicides that are aimed at weeds surrounding crops. The experiment has already backfired, with stronger weeds becoming immune to the toxins, and farmers becoming dependent on the need for more herbicides. Everyone loses in the deal, except makers of seeds and herbicides.

Why is it that, when pitted against corporate welfare, the welfare of the citizenry always seems to lose out? Short of banning GMOs outright, labeling is the very least that can be done. New Yorkers must be given a choice when it comes to the food that they eat.
