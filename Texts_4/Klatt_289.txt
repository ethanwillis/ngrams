Bible is consistent, reliable and accurate on creation.

I must respond to the Feb. 14 letter “Misguided arguments against evolution” written by Jeff Minor, that was a response to Rev. Brian W. Harrison’s Feb. 7 letter “Science of Darwin and his disciples is phony.”

Mr. Minor’s laboratory claims are interesting, although no evidence was presented. Plus his claim that mammalian proteins perform similar functions in worms falls far short of being convincing.

The real problem however is the massive numbers of questions and issues that evolutionists have few answers for. Rev. Harrison provided but a couple of excellent points. How about origins of life, origination of the DNA code, development of the sexes, how photosynthesis in plants developed in the first generation, resolving the Goldilocks principle, resolving the soft tissue, blood vessels, etc. found in dinosaur bones, just to name a few more?

And let's clear up a few other issues. Rev. Harrison’s article was scathing? After Richard Dawkins' attacks on Christians? I believe Mr. Minor needs a serious reality check.

Furthermore Mr. Minor’s conclusion “there is no tangible evidence for a Creator” merely demonstrates his lack of knowledge of the subject matter. The Bible that describes the Creator and creation is (as Christians know) extremely supportive of itself, consistent, reliable and accurate. Compare that to evolutionary science, which has always been all over the board. And this is just one reason why Christians have no reason to doubt the description of creation.

Finally the theory of evolution is not being suppressed. What is being suppressed is the mountain of evidence that unravels this absurd ideology.
