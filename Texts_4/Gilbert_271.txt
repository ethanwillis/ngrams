Intelligent design is not a scientific model.

The ongoing public conflict between opponents and proponents of intelligent design is absurd. Intelligent design cannot be disproven, so it is vain to argue against it. It has also not been validated according to scientific standards of evidence, so it is absurd to argue that it is scientific. Some scientists may speculate upon its validity as a matter of personal opinion, but they do not speak for the scientific community at large, which is represented by the preponderance of the scientific literature.

The personal opinions of individual scientists are not at issue. Some may dissent. Many intelligent people speculate upon the notion of an underlying design (or designer) and purpose for the universe, just as physicists speculate upon the existence of multiple universes and string theory, neither of which are currently accepted theoretical models. No matter how precious a speculative model such as creationism may be to us, we cannot make it into a scientific model by argument alone.
