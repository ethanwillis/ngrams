More Research - And Labels - Needed For GMO Foods

Science is a continuous process, not a particular result. It’s constantly changing. The information we have now on genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, is largely industry research. It would be useful to have more studies from institutions that have nothing to gain from GMOs.

Most people are not going to keel over from GMOs, but there could be long-range effects. I am also concerned about the environmental consequences of GMOs — pesticide overuse, damage to butterflies from GMO corn, contamination of organic crops, and genetic pollution of wild relatives of major food crops, such as corn.

It took 50 years for science to determine that the herbicide atrazine (registered in 1950) has a detrimental effect on frogs and 40 years for research on Roundup’s glyphosate (registered in 1973) to show the DNA, fertility and cancer effects that Roundup can cause.

We need to label GMOs.
