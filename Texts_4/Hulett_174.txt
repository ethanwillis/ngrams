Wonders Whether Genetically Modified Seeds Are a Good Thing.

Your glowing article on Monsanto's expansion ("Monsanto expansion will add 675 jobs here," April 24) left out the dark side of the genetically modified seed business.

Recently, in California, a resolution was put on the ballot requiring foods with genetically modified ingredients to be labeled as such.

Monsanto, and other genetically modified seed businesses, spent a great deal of money to defeat that measure. Why? If their product is such a wonderful thing, why wouldn't they want people to know it was in the foods they eat?

Personally, I wonder if genetically modified seeds are a good thing. The fact that many thousands of farmers in India have committed suicide, apparently due to the failure of those genetically modified seeds to perform as advertised, would be at the top of my list for why the genetically modified seeds may not be a good idea. Death is a horrible price to pay for the failure of seeds.

Also: Since we humans aren't genetically modified, what do the genetically modified substances in these seeds do to our bodies? There is an old saying: "You are what you eat."  Back when everything we ate was natural, and came from the family farm, and it was not laden with pesticides, cancer, for example, was seldom heard of. With cancer and other disease rates soaring, maybe we should start being more than a little concerned about what we are eating, and what it may be doing to our non-genetically modified bodies.
