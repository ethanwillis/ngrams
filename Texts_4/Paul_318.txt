Allow both evolution, creationism to be heard.

In response to Jim Curryâ€™s July 15 letter, "Creation science not based on research," I would remind Curry what scientific research entails. The important concept in scientific research is that it is repeatable. Not only can the original investigator be able to duplicate his results, but other investigators can also duplicate the original experiment. Evolutionary theory is a belief about supposed historical events. The events cannot be duplicated, as no historical event can be exactly repeated.

The simple fact is that evolutionists and creationists both use the same evidence to support their positions: fossils, DNA, radioactive dating, physiology. The only difference is their worldviews in how they interpret it. Both points of view are valid to be discussed in the science classroom as both deals with the origin of life. When one side feels so threatened as to not even allow discussion of an opposing view, then that might be a clue that it has something to hide.
