Bob Metcalfe makes a compelling case for the need for a new wave of nuclear power generators. Small-size or modular reactors can play a vital role in addressing the modern energy challenges posed by climate change, depleting reserves of fossil fuel, volatile markets and energy security.

In my view, Mr. Metcalfe misses the one area where small-size reactors could make their greatest contribution -- the developing world. As a clean, cheap and safe alternative to fossil fuels, small-size reactors have the potential to drive economic and social development in large parts of the world currently held back by their shortage of energy.

Small and modular reactors enable power to be generated locally, creating opportunities for economic growth in isolated areas, without the need for huge investment in national power distribution networks. In the longer-term, the use of nuclear energy to provide heat and water will help fight hunger, disease, poor sanitation, and water shortages in poorer countries.

The next generation of nuclear power is not only a solution to the energy challenges of the developed world but can be a strong driver of global development and low-carbon prosperity.
