On Feb. 9 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted to license two new nuclear plants in Georgia, raising two questions: Do we need nuclear power? Can we build safe nuclear plants? The answer to both is yes!

The world’s energy needs are growing. By midcentury the world’s population is expected to be nine billion, nearly 30 percent more than today’s.

More important, the push by developing countries to increase their standard of living is inexorably tied to a corresponding increase in energy consumption. World electricity consumption by midcentury will probably be between two and four times what it is today. And our aging power plants will have to be replaced before then.

This enormous demand for new generating capacity must be met while also containing global warming and minimizing pollution and other environmental damage. But how?

Solar and wind energy are nowhere near ready to take on this kind of load. Coal, oil and gas are polluters and major carbon dioxide generators — hence major contributors to global warming. Oil and gas also have geopolitical issues. Nuclear power is the only major electricity source that is both ready and does not contribute to global warming.

There is no question that nuclear plants must be built with the highest regard to safety. Modern nuclear plant designs therefore incorporate greatly enhanced safety features that, for example, allow a reactor to shut down and cool itself by natural forces like gravity and natural circulation, without external electrical power. Fukushima could not happen in these plants.

We need all the electricity sources we can get. Let’s not exclude clean and safe nuclear energy.
