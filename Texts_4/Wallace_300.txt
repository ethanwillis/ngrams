Teach students both theories of origins of life.

David Grow berates a proposed state Senate bill to promote critical thinking in our science classrooms, claiming it would address “controversial topics.” Haven’t nearly all major advances in science through the centuries been claimed to be “controversial”? Currently, the only two major theories about the genetic origins of life are Darwinian evolution and creationism. Only the first theory is taught. Startling scientific discoveries in recent years are continually undermining its foundations, pointing more toward the second theory.

However, neither theory can be scientifically verified (observable, repeatable, verifiable). Let’s develop open, inquiring minds. Both theories should be taught — and may the best theory “win” — until a third and more scientifically provable theory is found. That’s true science, not outmoded Darwinism-worshipping dogma. I applaud the Senate for exploring ways to enhance critical thinking in our schools. After 40 years of agenda-driven, monopolistic pseudo-science, it’s about time!
